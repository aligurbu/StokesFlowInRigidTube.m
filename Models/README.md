# Description of the tube models

The vessel boundary is partitioned into the inlet, outlet, and sidewall in order to assign the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the relevant part of the boundaries. The extracellular plasma flow is generated by imposing the pressure gradient along the vessel length by applying a prescribed pressure on the inlet surface and setting the outlet surface to be the traction-free surface (zero-pressure). These traction boundary conditions on the inlet and outlet surfaces are referred to as the Neumann boundary conditions. The zero-velocity field (no-slip condition) is assumed on the vessel sidewall, which amounts to the Dirichlet boundary condition.
