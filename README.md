# StokesFlowInRigidTube.m

- High-order weakly singular boundary element method code is presented for analyzing pressure-driven viscous flow in the rigid vessel with varying cross-sections.
- This code was developed for part of [my dissertation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355033649_Simulations_of_Red_Blood_Cell_Flow_by_Boundary_Integral_Methods) (Chapter 5) to simulate the red blood cell flow using boundary integral methods.
- This repository contains the code for the examples presented in Chapter 5.
